Support Vector Machines (SVM)🎯 🤖 🔧⚙️ 📊  

Overview  
This project focuses on binary classification using an SVM model. The dataset is carefully prepared, and different kernels (linear and RBF) are explored. Hyperparameter tuning ensures optimal model performance, and cross-validation provides a robust evaluation. 🚀  

Steps Involved  
1️⃣ Load and preprocess dataset  
2️⃣ Train SVM using linear and RBF kernel  
3️⃣ Tune hyperparameters (C & gamma) for best results  
4️⃣ Evaluate model performance with cross-validation  

Results & Insights  
- Linear and RBF kernels provide different decision boundaries 🧐  
- Hyperparameter tuning significantly impacts accuracy 🎯  
- Cross-validation ensures reliability and avoids overfitting ⚖️  

Next Steps
